INDI Driver for ffmpeg devices

This driver is used to perform benchmarking tests in the indi blob transfer operation.
As for now it only reads a v4l2 video device ans sends each frame to the indiserver in its original pixelformat and size.
It may be buggy as I just start it to adopt the recent indiccd capabilities framework.
